# StockOrderBook with C++20

 This is a simple stock market order book, used to keep track of the exchangement of shares across the market. 

 I use an **unordered_map** to keep track of all the equities available in the books for constant lookup times and the user can perform many kinds of operations, including:

 *  Add order
 *  Cancel Order
 *  Print all the orders
 *  Match Order (Buy/Sell, Fill, etc)
